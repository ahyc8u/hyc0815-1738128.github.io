        <h1>Level 1: Newbie</h1>
        <p1>This is the first paragraph with the normal font.</p1>
        <p1>One thing I really like about PMSS is that we accept international students from various countries every year.  
            I meet new friends each year and build friendships all over the world.  
            I am also happy to learn more about other countries and let people know more about my home country Taiwan. 
            Being an international student, I am glad that PMSS provides what it is like to study in a North American country.  
            Unlike many high schools that are closer to the west coast, PMSS is not that asian-dominated.  
            It is such an advantage because international students are able to learn English in a real Canadian environment. </p1>
        <p></p>
        <p2>This is the second paragraph with the italic font.</p2>
        <p2>The most incredible thing that has happened this year is the introduction of Flex.  
            I believe it works perfectly and wish it could have been brought into our schedule earlier.  
            With Flex, classes are not as long.  
            I found it better to not have classes as eighty minutes long because I believe not everyone has long attention span, and class time can be used more efficiently.  
            Also, Flex helps students to be responsible for their time management, and they could do some work at school and rest more at home.  
            It is also the best time for students to ask teachers questions or for teachers to open tutorials so that classes will not be interrupted, 
            and students do not have to stay after school and be worrying about if the teachers have gone home.</p2>
